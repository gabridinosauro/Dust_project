# Dust project

Hello,
This is a step by step process to repeat the data analysis done in the paper:
"Linking dust dispersal and spatial distribution of microbes in a complex semi-arid region"

There are three steps: 
1)The first one is the bioinformatic procedure that, from demultiplexed data brings you to two ASV count tables one Bacteria/Archaea and one Fungi. Taxa tables will be also produced.

2)The second step brings you from an ASV count table, for both Bacteria/Archaea communities to a  phyloseq objects where ASV count tables, taxonomy and metadata of each condition is going to be used.

For convenience, the data will be divided in four data sets.

1) Spatial dataset for Bacteria/Archaea, this includes all the soil samples analyzed
2) Spatial dataset for Fungi
3) Dust dataset for Bacteria/Archaea,  this includes soil samples and dust samples
